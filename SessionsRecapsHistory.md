## Optimizing For Promotion In Tech
Our recap for this first session was actually quite brief as this was before the Slack community and @Rahul Pandey and I had 0 clue what we were doing. So here's a real recap of that session:
1. Promotion is about behavior, not output
a. This is the #1 most important thing about promotion if you're only going to retain 1 thing from this recap, make it this.
b. You can only scale output so much as you are limited by the number of hours in a day and how much you can push your body/mind before it burns out.
c. Senior engineers are senior because they add multiplicative value, not additive. They build solutions that help broad swaths of people across the company, not 1-off implementations for random features that junior engineers are often saddled with.
2. Perception matters. Acting altruistically will give you a higher chance of promotion
a. In the end, you always work on a team. Don't be someone who only cares about promotion as this will lead to toxic and territorial behavior that ultimately hurts your chances of promotion.
2. Engineers become more senior because they increase their scope, helping and empowering more people across the company. You can't do this if you act in a selfish way.
3. Proper self-presentation is crucial
a. In an ideal world, your manager and everyone in your reporting chain would automatically know all the hard work you did and you'll get promoted every time you deserve it. That is not the case, especially in a fast-moving, chaotic company (which most top tech companies like Facebook are).
b. At Facebook, there is something called the "self-review" where you laid out everything major you did and the impact you had in an organized way. If the company doesn't force you to do this, you should just do it yourself whenever it's promo season.
c. It is immensely helpful to keep a running journal of everything you did each week, so you don't need to claw back 6-12 months into the past every promo cycle.
4. Switching companies is a powerful lever
a. Companies are not exactly pure engines of goodwill, even top tech companies like Facebook.
2. Often times you will be kept stagnant in your current job due to some mix of stupid obstacles. In this scenario, keep finding a job at a different company in mind as a powerful option. If you're a good engineer and you do well on a company's interview, they need to sweeten the deal to make up for the friction of you leaving your current job to join them. This can end up being a promotion!


## Evolving Your Job As Your Company Changes

Recap of the session with Girish, who's currently an engineering director at Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and was at Facebook for a whopping 11 years:
* There isn’t a single correct answer for which company you should join early in your career. However, joining a mid-sized, fast growing company offers a good combination of great mentorship + responsibility.
* Small companies will give you less mentorship but you’ll likely have wider responsibilities. You probably won’t become an industry expert, but you’ll figure out how everything fits together.
* Large companies will allow you to focus on a particular niche and tackle problems that most others don’t have the luxury of tackling. You’ll also have well-defined paths for career progression + the ability to switch teams if you want. In particular, you will learn how to actually scale products to millions if not billions of users.

## What Does a Product Manager Do And Why You Should Become One
Recap of the session with Tulsee, who's currently a Google Product Lead for ML Fairness and Responsible AI:
* PMs are the voice of the user and decide the direction of the product. Being a PM typically means you have much more scope than an equivalent level engineer (at least early in your career)
* The job of a PM is largely “influence without authority”, so you structure the framework for decision-making, pull in the right data, and work with stakeholders w/o always being the final decision maker
* APM (Associate Product Manager) Programs are a nice, structured way to become a PM, with support + training

## Building Meaningful Side Projects

Recap:
1. Don't be afraid to build something "boring" - It is easy to get lost working with something "cool" like blockchain where your chances of success are low due to the unknowns and instability associated with that tech. There is tremendous value in building a powerful solution to a relatively small problem, more than most people think. If you are on the more junior side, it also makes more sense to start off with something simple for the sake of your gradual progression. You don't become a master overnight.
2. It takes time for a product to take off - It usually takes at least a couple iterations for your product to have enough features and be polished enough to reach a critical mass of users who find it genuinely useful. Don't just expect to drop a raw MVP (minimum viable product) and expect it to take off. Most of a product's value comes from the execution, not the raw idea itself.
3. Solve a problem you are close to - By solving for a problem you or someone close to you has, you will naturally be more passionate and motivated about solving that problem. Once you have the product out, you will also be able to get valuable feedback on the product easily, either from yourself or that person close to you. By "feeling the pain" of every bug and inefficiency your product has, you can craft a truly elegant solution. If you solve for a problem that you aren't really close to, you won't be able to build that true user understanding and will likely end up with a product that either solves nothing or solves a problem extremely poorly.

## How To Learn Quickly In Tech"

Recap:
1. Don't be afraid to ask questions
a. If there's a metric you should judge yourself against in your first 2 months on a new team, it's how many questions you ask.
b. It is not a sign of strength to "tough it out" and figure out a complex thing on your own after several days/weeks when you can figure it out in just 30 minutes by asking someone for help. It is a sign of weakness to do this as you are afraid to confront your own weaknesses. Conversely, it is a sign of emotional strength to be vulnerable and share this with someone else, asking them for help.
c. There is no such thing as a stupid question. Don't fret too much about the optics of your question and just ask!
d. In the end, you will "feed back into" the balance as you will eventually reach a point where you are the one answering questions. By helping foster a truly open culture where anybody is comfortable asking or answering a question, you set up your entire team for success.
2. Ask effective questions
a. In general, try to unblock yourself for 15-30 minutes before asking a question, a few hours tops. You just want to avoid the nightmare scenario from before where you just bang your head against a wall for days/weeks.
b. Explain where you are now. Detail what you tried already and what outcome it produced. You should have this from the 15-30 minutes of work mentioned before. Your goal here is to cut out the wasteful feedback loops where you go to someone and they ask if you have already done some pretty obvious thing (which you should have done in that 15-30 minutes).
c. Be polite - Make it clear that you respect the answerer's time by including phrases like "Whenever you get a moment" and "If you're too busy, no worries if you can't answer". Always thank the answerer, even if they didn't give you a complete answer or any answer at all. Remember, the answerer gifted you their most valuable resource: Time.
d. Attach resources - Screenshot, stack traces, actual code: Doesn't matter what it is, just attach it to your question. A picture (or code snippet) is worth 1,000 words.
3. Work backwards from where you want to be
a. When you focus only on what you already have and are now, it's easy to get tunnel vision, lose sight of the bigger picture, and fall into a reactive state. When you're just starting a project, it's also common to just feel helpless when you're only thinking of where you are now because you simply have nothing.
b. By working backwards and envisioning every single piece that needs to fall into place, it forces you to have a holistic view of the system. From there, you can break the overall system into components and then talk to the proper POC for each component to get a high-level overview of the entire system, putting you well on your way towards becoming a lead in that space.

Here's also a very tactical "playbook" to becoming familiar in a new team, "A Career Cold Start Algorithm" from Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook VP: https://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start

## How To Build A Successful Startup

Recap of the session with @Clarence Chio, the founder of Unit21, a security startup that's funded by Google and recently secured its Series A:
* You must talk to customers and understand what product to build. You cannot build your way to a solution in a startup. Put in a very concrete way, building actually comes last.
* You will likely be very bad at hiring and managing a team as a first time founder. Find a coach who can help you get better, and be prepared to learn on the job.
* Finding a community of like-minded people is important for finding a cofounder and committing to a startup. Clarence was part of South Park Commons for example, a community of domain experts where everyone can jam on ideas together.

## Productivity Tips as an Engineer
Recap:
1. Solve the hardest problem first
a. It may be tempting to solve the easiest problems first, but this can leave you with a false sense of confidence.
b. Often times what turns out to be the solution to the hardest problem will have ramifications all across the architecture. Solving the core, central hard problem can transform what you thought were the “easy” tasks before.
c. Tackling the hardest problem first is also crucial to failing fast. Sometimes the hardest problem is literally an impossible problem. The sooner you figure that out, the sooner you can kill the project and move on.
2. Build as much as you can like a library
a. Alex did the same with his side projects. He is able to write thousands of lines of code per day, because a lot of it is frankly copy-paste. He can copy-paste it, because he always designs his code as modules, so at least 50% of his code is “drag-and-dropp-able”.
b. A concrete way to think about this idea is “Avoid monoliths”. Bad engineers in particular will create massive classes that hold all their logic; this is usually the view controller when you’re building user-facing products. When you do this, pretty much none of your code is reusable.
3. Learn when to skip meetings
a. One of the easiest ways to waste your time, especially in older, more bureaucratic companies, is to languish in meetings.
b. If your work culture allows for it like Facebook, don’t be afraid to skip meetings. There is a “Reject invite” button for a reason.
4. Identify if you’re a context switcher or focuser and build around that
a. If you’re a context switcher: Great! The main things to do here are to continue building the muscle by context switching more often and being able to identify pockets of time where you can be productive.
b. If you don’t like context switching and are the most productive when you are able to focus, make focus blocks. Concentrate similar work (like meetings) on certain days. Aggressively reject non-relevant meetings.
Keep a journal and stay in tune with your gut
Figuring out how to maximize your productivity is a self-learning exercise. Most people in the beginning of their careers do not know what circumstances they need to shine.
Keep some sort of record of what you are doing week or week (or even day over day) and regularly reflect on which weeks were bad (“Argh, I got nothing done”) and which ones were good (“Wow, I crushed it”). Think about why the good weeks were good and why the bad weeks were bad.
c. Be honest with yourself, particularly with things you don’t like. If something feels like a chore, recognize it and tell your manager.
On a side note, notion is supposedly a great note taking tool: https://www.notion.so/

## How To Ace Your Tech Interview
Overall Approach
1. Interviews suck but they get better as you do more of them. Use companies you're less excited about as practice fodder.
2. Try to pack together all interviews with companies you care about within the same time window, so you can get a slew of competing offers to maximize your compensation.
3. Interview even if you're happy with your job. If it's been a couple years and you have a bit of an itch for something new, just put yourself out there. It's a good exercise to keep this crucial muscle in check, explore the world, and get a feeling on whether you are being paid what you're worth.

**Preparation**
1. If you have a big company interview, just get Leetcode Premium. It's such a no brainer - You are literally paying 35 or 70 dollars to increase your chances of landing a prestigious $100k+ job by several percentage points.
2. Find a buddy to mock interview you! It's so valuable being able to bounce ideas off of a human. https://interviewing.io/ is a tool that lets you do this and has a free tier.
3. Take frequent breaks! Alex takes a ~30 minute break (about enough for an episode of something on Netflix, haha) for every ~2 hours of work.

**During the interview**
1. Interviews should feel more like a conversation vs. a test. A good interviewer is trying to bring out the best in you. Let them do that by having a healthy dialogue with them vs. staying silent.
2. Done is better than perfect. It's always good to present multiple options, especially the bad ones. It shouldn't be your goal to jump to the optimal solution immediately.

**Post interview**
1. Take the part where you can ask the interviewer questions about the company seriously. Avoid the generic "What is your favorite thing about the company?" and "What is your day to day like?" Ask questions that make the interviewer think and cover the company's future.
2. Interviews produce a lot of false negatives and can frankly be stupid a lot of the time. Don't get too down when you get rejected from a place where you thought you nailed it. That is just how the game works - Use this as inspiration to come back better than ever.

**System design questions**
1. If you are coding, you are failing. You should be drawing boxes with arrows.
2. You can easily prepare for these by learning how major products are built at a high-level. These companies often times have engineering blogs where they explain this. Read them.
3. There is no right answer with these questions. What's important is that you have a deep understanding of pros and cons of all the different approaches.

## Choosing Your Path As A Software Engineer

**Discovering Your Passion**
1. You’re not born with a passion - it’s something you work on and cultivate over time.
2. Experiment early on in your career when you can handle the chaos. It’s easier to experiment at large companies since they have the infrastructure to support engineers shifting around. 
3. If you can’t experiment from work, experiment with side projects! See the recap from our side project talk :)
4. Build in time to reflect each week: what felt fun, neutral, and negative? Think about non-code aspects as well, like working with XFN (product, design) and mentoring people.
5. Talk to your manager! A good manager will help you build your future.
6. Find people who you want to spend 8+ hours/day with, along with people who will invest in your growth and your success.
7. Money is an important practical consideration when deciding your career path. Use levels.fyi for big company compensation comparison. 

**Finding The Proper Company**
1. If you are risk averse, bigger is better. Startups are very risky so you should join if you have conviction (e.g. trust the founders, investors, belief in product). 
2. Impact is another dimension to consider. You may work on something cool at a startup, but not many people use it. At a larger company you’ll work on something narrow but many people use it. 
3. Unicorns (or mid-sized companies) are usually a good balance between absolute chaos (tiny startup) and bulwark of stability (Facebook/Google).

**Finding The Proper Stack**
1. If you like being close to the user, work on the product by focusing on Android/iOS/Web development.
2. If you aren’t super visual and don’t want to deal with finicky users (hard to predict their behavior), consider something more backend: ML, infra, etc.
3. Most companies will prefer “dumb clients, smart servers”. So there’s more opportunity for technical complexity the further away you get from the user.

**Finding The Proper Senior Path**
1. If you like growing people, consider becoming a manager. This is something introverts can be good at too as a lot of management is deep 1:1 connection.
2. If you like connecting and empowering people but want to stay within the code, you can become a tech lead.
3. If you like deep tech work as a lone wolf, you can become a technical specialist. Big companies are generally better for these kinds of engineers.

## Using Content Creation To Boost Your Tech Skills

1. **There are a ton of benefits to technical content creation**
    * Teaching forces you to learn. You’ll be able to communicate a concept clearly when you understand it well.
    * Content creation will lead to improving your communication and presentation skills. This becomes increasingly important as you become more senior as a tech lead or manager- your job is about influence. 
    * Creating content will naturally lead to developing your brand, which will lead to speaking opportunities or jobs.
    * More broadly, your content will give you the opportunity to “find serendipity” - people are better able to connect you with opportunity.
    * You have the ability to help people, especially if you put your content on a platform where you can get searched or recommended (YouTube/Medium).
2. **Our best advice to get started:**
    * Focus on quantity over quality. Rather than spending too much time on making perfect content, make content that’s good enough and hit the publish button. The more content you make, the better you’ll get, simply in the process of doing. 
    * Don’t worry about judgment from friends or family. You’re almost certainly overestimating how much they care and/or how much time they’ll spend on you.
    * Don’t be discouraged if no one consumes your content. Trust the process- due to the nonlinear nature of these digital platforms, you can create 50 pieces of content, and then the 51st will be watched/read more than everything prior.
    * If you don’t have a content idea, start with an existing topic but embed your narrative. Explaining something in your own words has a lot of value, at minimum to you, and potentially to others in the world.
    * The hard part is not creating a single piece of content, but doing it consistently for a year or more.
3. ** Pick a suitable platform: **
    * YouTube: 2nd largest search engine in the world, huge amounts of time spent per day. Combines audio + visual aspects which is harder to get right, but the audience is more cohesive + valuable. 
    * Medium: the go-to destination for technical blogs. Submitting your articles to publications will get you distribution. Much less community oriented, and it’s easier for people to create content.  
    * Your own blog: preferred if you’re writing more for yourself. You can cross post content to Medium. For discovery, you’ll have to rely on Google SEO which takes a long time. 
    * Other platforms: LinkedIn, Twitter, Clubhouse, TikTok. Do them if you enjoy them, but it’s really hard to create a “portfolio” of high quality content, and it may be harder to stand out.
    * I picked YT since it combines 3 skills: technical competency, communication ability, and video editing. The combination of all 3 is quite rare, which makes the content more valuable.

## Succeeding as a Self Taught Dev/Bootcamp Grad” - thanks to special guest @Kris for joining us:
1. Studying
    * Know what type of SWE you want to become, e.g. front-end, back-end, automation engineer, etc.
    * Pick the best studying option for yourself: studying on your own or going to a boot camp. The answer here depends on how much help/mentorship you can get on your own, and how much you want the structure of a bootcamp.
    * Learn everything you need to know to land the job you want.
2. Apply for jobs is a numbers game: the more you apply, the higher your chances.   * It’s easy to apply for many jobs through sites like LinkedIn or AngelList. Find a referral if you can. Try to stand out from other applicants with your projects.
3. Passing the interview
    * Study common algorithm patterns and practice on sites like LeetCode.
    * Prepare for all kinds of interviews - technical, behavioral, company fit.
    * Review your interview experiences - write down the questions you got and how you could have answered them better.
    * Negotiate your offers. There are many resources for this online, and we’ll likely have a session about it!
4. After landing your first job, it’ll be much easier to land your next job. The lack of a CS degree won’t matter after your first job.

The path can be demoralizing if you’re self-taught. Believe in yourself and find motivation from other successful devs with a similar background. You will succeed!!

## How To Build Side Project Apps With 100k+ Users (For Free!)
Huge thanks to the ~175 of you who showed up for the session today. In case you missed it (or if you just want something for your notes), here's the recap for the session:

**Why side projects?**
    * They are an incredibly powerful job-finding lever. Both Alex and Rahul greatly leveraged them to really advance their careers (covered below).
    * With the exponential recent increase in resource availability online, deploying a production app to thousands if not millions of users nowadays is actually quite easy from a technical perspective.

**Alex’s story**
    * PayPal (Alex's first job) didn’t let Alex do Android even though he already knew it was his passion.
    * When switching jobs, Course Hero gave Alex a job as their 1st Android engineer (and Android tech lead by default, hehe) because of his side projects, which were actually a focal point of his system design round with the CTO. The job posting wanted 3+ years of professional Android experience. Alex had 0.
    * From his solid Course Hero background, Alex was able to get into Facebook as an Android engineer where he also talked about his side projects a lot during his interview.
    * Without his side projects, it’s likely Alex wouldn’t be where he is today.
**Rahul’s story**
    * Started out as ML engineer doing recommendation systems. But Rahul wasn’t excited about this that much as he wanted something more tangible.
    * Recommendations inherently require lots of a data, and there’s not as much of a deliverable. Android was appealing for that. 
    * Rahul joined Codepath Android where they taught these classes about mobile development; that forced Rahul to learn with social accountability.
    
**Don’t be afraid to do something boring and simple**
    * Case in point: Alex’s most popular side project just picks a random item from a list and is effectively just a wrapper around Math.rand(). Despite this, it took him 75,000+ lines of code changes to get there and the app has 800,000+ downloads and 4,300+ ratings with a 4.5+ average (very positive feedback). It has legitimately helped thousands of people.
    * A side project, as the name suggests, is something you do on the side. It shouldn’t be too complicated - Otherwise you are dipping into full startup territory (a topic for another day).
    * Newgrads and junior engineers in particular are often chock full of ambition and overestimate their abilities. Everyone here truly has the potential to change the world and build something massive and revolutionary - But we need to be realistic. In order to become great, you need to practice, practice, practice. And that means doing the simple things first!
    * Any product you see, especially if you’re junior, is likely 5x more complex than you think it is. Merely getting something to work is very, very different from truly building a delightful to use solution.

**Solve for a problem you’re close to**
    * Random Name Picker was purely built because Alex wanted to help one of his best friends who was a math teacher have an easy way to pick a student to call on in class. Alex eventually started using the app himself to choose what restaurant to go to when he was hanging out with friends.
    * Passion is the real 10x-er. You will naturally give the side project your all if you solve for a problem close to you, because it either directly improves your life or that of somebody you care about. If you're building some app or website, you should be using it yourself regularly to truly understand the end-user.
    * People often times latch onto the latest shiny thing for their side project (machine learning, AR/VR, blockchain, etc) - This is usually a trap because the tech in those spaces, especially within what’s free and open-source, is usually quite nascent and hard to use.
    * Being close to the problem also means that you understand it and build something that is actually a solution for it. When people just use the latest technology, they often times build something that’s cool but isn’t actually used by anybody since it doesn’t solve a real people problem.

**Keep at it, iterate, and improve**
    * Expanding on the idea of not just following a basic tech tutorial and expecting it to blow up from there - In order for something to truly evolve into something useful, you need to keep refining it and refining it. Just publishing a website or app is not the finish line. When you want to seriously take a side project or any product in general to great heights, you are making a commitment - You should be ready to invest ~30 minutes per day on average across 2 months.
    * There is a lot of value in simply doing something better than everybody else. That’s actually what most successful tech companies are (look at WhatsApp). It is pretty rare for something to be successful merely because of the raw innovation behind the idea.
    * It took 3 months before Random Name Picker moved out of single digit downloads per day.
    * True value comes from what you can’t simply find within an online tutorial. Growing a product and the community that blossoms around it fall into this category.
**Provide 6 Stars out of 5 service**
    * This is how Brian Chesky started Airbnb: In the beginning, it is so crucial that your initial users don’t just like you and your product but that they love it. Chesky achieved this by imagining what 5 star service would be and then going 1 step beyond.
    * Some examples of Airbnb doing this: Visiting every single one of their first 100 users. Taking professional photos for them. Alex does this by responding to every single review and feedback email for an app he cares about until 1,000 reviews (which ends up being 25-50k downloads).
    * Make sure that you are pixel perfect. Every error flow and edge case in general needs to be covered. Keep the binary small. Add delightful animations where you can.
    * Often times, Alex will get a feature request and hack it out the next day, sometimes within 2-3 hours.
    * This process of treating feedback as a gift and fixing every tiny little flaw will naturally lead to a lot of updates. For apps, this is helpful as the app search algorithm across both Google and Apple uses frequent updates as a positive signal.
    * Beat everyone else. Look at competing apps in the space and build out features they don’t have or build out the features they do have and make them better.
For those of you who missed the session but wanted to attend it - Don't worry, we will probably give it again in a few months. For future sessions, just make sure you check out the #general channel every once in a while or follow the LinkedIn community: https://www.linkedin.com/company/techcareergrowth/. Have an amazing weekend everyone!

## How To Ace Your Top Big Tech Company Software Interview

Thanks to the 500+ of you who joined us earlier today for the session “How To Ace Your Top Big Tech Company Software Interview”. This is by far the largest session we had! We’ll be better about anticipating demand in the future (so no one get rejected by Zoom). Recap:

**Getting The Interview**
    * If you’re in school and the companies come visit -> Grind the career fairs. Show up early, have an amazing resume, work on your people skills.
    * If you made it as an intern -> Take your internship seriously. Companies want to put up a lot of fun events for flexibility and optics - there’s a tension between that and the fact that interns are strictly judged.
    * Network with friends at school, connect on LinkedIn, and hang out with coworkers. If you make 100 friends, chances are that at least 1 of them will make it into a top tech giant within a few years. Referrals are very valuable to get the initial interview.
    * For all other cases (most people), the best strategy is: Keep doing good work, be patient, and keep trying. Life is not a race - you don’t need to get into a top tech giant right now.
    * Less direct, + more risky (not recommended):
        * Contribute to their open source - It is very difficult to modify large codebases, and the bar for getting your PR merged is insanely high.
        * Side projects - In order to get noticed by this caliber of company though, you need something huge. Think 10,000+ users at the very least.

**Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Preparation**
For entry/mid level roles, DSA is, on average, 70% of the interview.
    * Our recommended resources (but use what you know/trust)
        * Leetcode: focus on easy + medium problems, and premium is probably worth it.
        * Glassdoor: especially valuable for larger companies with lots of data.
    * Make it a habit - DSA is similar to exercise. A lot of people don’t like to do it, but it’s good for you. Try to do 30+ minutes a day, 5+ days a week to prepare.
    * Take breaks - As mentioned before, interviewing is exhausting; if all you do is grind and cram, your mental state will not be good enough for the interview.
    * Find a buddy -  social accountability + simulating the real thing.
    * Don’t get discouraged - Progress will come in leaps and bounds, it won’t be constant. Be input-driven rather that output-driven.

**DSA Interview Tips:**
    * Ask a lot of questions to scope down the problem
    * Before diving into a particular approach, confirm proactively with the interviewer that they’re happy with it. It is in their best interest to prevent you from walking into your own death trap.
    * Don’t ignore information + hints from the interviewer
        * If there’s some info in the question, you should probably use it
        * If the interviewer is prodding you in a direction, it probably means you need to think about that more
    * Start with a dumb/brute force solution, but acknowledge the shortcomings. Done is better than perfect. After you get something basic working, iterate on it.
    * Keep an open dialog with the interviewer during the question
        * >5 minutes of silence is bad
        * Interviewer may be distracted/bad, so your job is to ask questions and elicit a reaction
    * Don’t be arrogant - strike a balance between understanding and questioning. 

**Behavioral Interview**
    * Your goal with every answer is to show 1 of 3 signals:
        * You’re passionate about software engineering
        * You’re passionate about the company you’re interviewing for
        * You work well with others
    * Have real questions for the interviewer. Avoid the overdone “What do you like about X”.
    * Mock interviewing with a friend is extremely helpful.

**Architecture Interview**
    * If you are coding, then you are failing, your goal is to draw boxes with arrows.
    * Even though most of us specialize in just part of the stack (front-end or back-end), you should build an understanding of how products work end to end. This includes:
        * Front-end
        * API layer (knowing JSON REST stuff should be enough)
        * Persistence layer (database and schema design)
    * Prepare by learning how big apps are built at a high-level. Refine the product definition and cover the edge cases.
**Conclusion**
    * Interviewing is a numbers game, don’t be discouraged if you fail your first interviews (we certainly have :slightly_smiling_face:)
    * Large companies have purposely streamlined the interview to make it scalable and consistent. There is a very clear correlation between your time spent and your chance of getting in.
    * Patience + practice is key!

## How To Become A 10x Engineer! 
Thanks for joining a tumultuous session yesterday about How To Become A 10x Engineer! Recap:
**Outliers Are Uniquely Possible in Software**
    * The software industry has leverage unlike any other field, so it’s possible for individuals (or small groups of people) to have outsized impact. 
    * Copying and modifying software is generally free and easy, which means good ideas spread fast (unlike other industries like Mechanical Engineering)
    * The software industry is very young, so best practices are still being identified

**Feedback Is A Gift**
    * People in tech are talented - If they have advice, take it
    * Don’t be defensive taking feedback - accept it openly and then actively try to understand + implement it.
    * Gracefully accepting feedback builds social capital (see below)

**See Problems You’re Afraid Of As An Opportunity**
    *   Average developers will stay in comfortable spaces; 10x engineers jump into scary problems
    * Growth is maximized when you’re uncomfortable
    * Tactical tip: Try as hard as you can to break your code. Make it “uncomfortable”!

**Ruthlessly Prioritize**
    * It’s too easy to get lost in today’s information overload
    * Have a clear set of goals and work backwards - identify just one thing that’s important to get done, and spend time on that first
    * Every once in a while, write down everything you’re doing to identify what’s important and “trim the fat”

**10,000 Hours**
    * If you put 10,000 hours into 1 thing, you will become amazing at that 1 thing
    * Remember the “into 1 thing” - Focus is crucial! You don’t want it to be too narrow (“View alignment in Android ConstraintLayout”) or too broad (“All of software dev”)
    * Eventually you will reach a “zen state” where you realize all tech frameworks are actually the same

**Aggressively Put Others Before Yourself**
    * Average engineers view the world transactionally; 10x engineers understand the concept of social capital. High empathy -> More social capital
    * 10x engineers work through others to multiply their impact, so your relationships are essential
    * When you disagree with someone, try to tear down your own argument

**Common Behaviors of the Best Engineers**
    * Solve problems on their own vs plug in a solution (specialization vs “pipe fitting”). Most of the time you’re on one end of the spectrum; both have huge impact.
    * Advocate for a new style of thinking (could lead to adopting a framework or pattern).
    * Combats complexity by aggressively simplifying, refactoring, and fixing code. Remember that more time is spent reading code than writing code.

    Adding on to the above, here's an extended version of the slides we used for the "How To Become A 10x Engineer" session as well:
