Hey, this is Alex and if you're reading this, welcome to Tech Career Growth community! I originally wanted to write this more in the 3rd person, but that felt weird so you'll see 1st person references to myself.

## Be Kind And Respectful Of Others
One of the goals of Tech Career Growth community is to build a positive and supportive place where anybody can get the support they need, regardless of their background. Despite having 8,000+ members (as of 1/12/2022), we have been able to do this quite well and we want to keep it that way. We haven't had many problems here yet, so we won't go too far into the specifics of this. For now, we have these basic rules:

1. **Follow the Golden Rule** - Treat others the way you want to be treated, simple at that. This is the absolute bare minimum.
2. **Lean towards being overly polite** - You don't know how others will perceive you, especially when you and the people you're talking to come from different backgrounds. The different backgrounds thing will happen often in a community as diverse as Tech Career Growth. What's straightforward and "normal" for you may be perceived as cold, heartless, and maybe even ruthless by the receiving person. Always try to see what you're saying through the shoes of others before you send it, and tentative language + interweaved positivity go a long way. Instead of saying "This has a problem", say "I think this may have a problem." If you see a good question and need to give some frank feedback, you can preface it with "This is a great question!".
3. **When in doubt, do as Alex and Rahul do** - Rahul and I are always striving to respond in a polite, respectful, and thorough manner, and our goal is to set the example for the rest of the community. If you don't know how to communicate in a setting as large and diverse as Tech Career Growth, we totally understand - Just try to mirror us as much as possible.
4. **If someone helps you, thank them** - This community is purely an engine of goodwill; everyone here is just volunteering their time out of the goodness of their heart. If someone takes the time out of their day to help you, make sure to thank them. If they helped you out quite a lot, consider thanking them publicly in #shoutouts.

## Find The Right Channel
We want this community to be worth your time. This means that whenever you see a new message in a channel you are part of, it should have a high chance of being relevant or at least interesting to you.

If you're going to share posts in Slack, please take the time to find the right channel for your post before you post it. You can find an excellent graphic showing all the channels in our community below. The channel names are pretty self explanatory.

## Read The Channel Resources
Rahul and I make sure that every channel has a good collection of topic, description, and bookmarked/pinned resources, so you can understand the rules of any channel and see the great content that has already been shared and created within it. Please spend at least 10-15 minutes going through these before posting in the channel. This helps keep the channel a clean, focused place for healthy discussion and minimize the community having to solve the same problem twice.

## Learn To Ask Effective Questions
Something we want to do is allow for this community to be a "training ground" for you to grow the skills you need to succeed within a professional tech environment. A lot of you will (and maybe already do) work in tech companies that use Slack to collaborate and communicate. A tech job will have you collaborating with other tech people, and that's exactly what this community is about as well.

This means that you should take the time to make sure your questions are high-quality before you ask them, just like you would when you're working at an actual job. The more time and thought you put into your question, the faster you will get an effective answer and the better the overall community is for everyone. Rahul and I have spent many, many years learning that effective question asking is a deep skill and mastering this skill. We want you to develop an amazing question asking skill as well, and you can learn how to do just that by watching our [video playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS75nql2Csg&list=PL7NYbSE8uaBATZh90IhQgGJNulKUpRfYY&index=2).

It's no fun for anyone when a question is asked and isn't answered. Everyone in this community wants to help one another as much as possible and as fast as possible. Let's make that smoother and easier by watching the above playlist and asking great questions!

## The Easiest Way To Get More Back Is To Give
People notice when other people are nice and going out of their way to help others, especially in this community. If you want more, high-quality answers and support to your questions, try providing some of that yourself for the questions of others. I deeply believe that humans inherently value fairness, and there's something that intrinsically motivates us to help those who help us and those we see helping others.

This system applies to Rahul and I as well - We will spend extra time and effort supporting those we have seen already supporting others out of the kindness of their heart. Of course, if you want to come to this community just to get help with 1 thing and never return, you are welcome to do so. But if you want to get the most out of this community, which we want everyone in tech to do, try helping others along the way as well. Some of the best opportunities come when you help others.

## Don't Spam
This community is inherently a collaborative exercise as everything everyone does within it will be seen and get the attention of others in the community. We all need to work together to minimize noise and keep the community a high-signal resource for all. This manifests across the following rules:

1. **This isn't a place for you to make money** - This community is free, and we want to keep it that way. Do not ruin this spirit.
2. **Do not double post across large channels** - This is just noisy and creates a really bad experience for a lot of users due to overlap. It's not fun seeing 2 unread channels just to find out the unread post is the same thing twice.
3. **Minimize self-promotion** - We have many more focused channels like #content-creation, #events-and-scholarships, and stack specific channels for you to promote something you are involved in. Use those instead of broader channels like #random, and too much self-promotion in general breaks the spirit of this community and makes you look awkward within it.

Posts breaking these rules will be deleted and repeat offenders will be banned.

Rahul and I also keep a close eye on who we see participating and helping others within the community and who aren't. Those who don't participate in this community and are clearly only trying to leverage it for more selfish reasons (there are unfortunately a lot of people who come, self-promote something, and are never seen again) will have these rules enforced more strictly upon them.

## We Aren't Here To Help You Debug
I have always strongly believed: "Don't fix what ain't broke." An extension of this is that you shouldn't try to solve a problem that is already solved extremely well. When it comes to debugging problems, there is already a world-class solution that millions of people use every day: StackOverflow.

If you need help with debugging, please share your problem to StackOverflow instead and resolve it there. If you somehow aren't able to get an answer there after 2 weeks, you can try getting some extra eyeballs on it in the appropriate stack related channel like #web, #android, and #backend and linking that StackOverflow post. Make sure to attach a few sentence high-level description of what your problem is and pre-emptive thanks for the people who bothered to look too. **Any posts that don't follow this rule will be deleted and directed to this page.**

We originally allowed raw debugging posts in the Slack community, but we found that they overall had very low engagement and dominated the channel real estate due to lengthy stack traces and code snippets, making the overall Slack experience worse for everybody. They were also very rarely answered. Debugging posts are also very tricky in a broader tech community like ours as everyone uses different stacks. Even with thousands of people, you have an extremely low chance of finding someone who has encountered your exact problem before. Debugging is also something that requires a lot of time and context absorption; it is rarely something a casual passerby can just see, help solve, and then be on their way. A lot of community members help out here and there with various slivers of their free time given that this community is nobody's full-time job; let's respect their time by sharing problems that are easier to help out with.

**Long story short, our community isn't built to help debug code while StackOverflow very much is. Please use StackOverflow to solve this need when you have it instead of this Slack community.**

## Thank You
If you have read all the way here, you are amazing. I wish this document didn't have to be so long, but it turns out that there's a lot of complexity running a 8,000+ person community ðŸ˜† As a "reward" for absorbing all this content, you can send me (@Alex) a private message on Slack letting me know that you've finished my Slack essay and I will respond with a random parrot emoji of my choice. I hope you like it.
