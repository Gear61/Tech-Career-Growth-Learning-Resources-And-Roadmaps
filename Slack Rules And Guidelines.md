Hey, this is Alex and if you're reading this, welcome to Tech Career Growth community! I originally wanted to write this more in the 3rd person, but that felt weird so you'll see 1st person references to myself.

## Be Kind And Respectful Of Others
One of the goals of Tech Career Growth community is to build a positive and supportive place where anybody can get the support they need, regardless of background. Despite having 8,000+ members (as of 1/12/2022), we have been able to do this quite well and we want to keep it that way. We haven't had many problems yet, so we won't go too far into the specifics of this. For now, we have these basic rules:

1. **Follow the Golden Rule** - Treat others the way you want to be treated, simple at that. This is the absolute bare minimum.
2. **Lean towards being overly polite** - You don't know how others will perceive you, especially when you and the people you're talking to come from different backgrounds. The different backgrounds thing will happen often in a community as diverse as Tech Career Growth. What's straightforward and "normal" for you may be perceived as cold, heartless, and maybe even ruthless by the receiving person. Always try to see what you're saying through the shoes of others before you send it, and tentative language and interweaved positivity go a long way. Instead of saying "This has a problem", say "I think this may have a problem." If you see a good question and need to give some frank feedback, you can preface it with "This is a great question!".
3. **When in doubt, do as Alex and Rahul do** - Rahul and I are always striving to respond in a polite, respectful, and thorough manner, and our goal is to set the example for the rest of the community. If you don't know how to communicate in a setting as large and diverse as Tech Career Growth, we totally understand - Just try to mirror us as much as possible.

## Find The Right Channel
We want this community to be worth your time. This means that whenever you see a new message in a channel you are part of, it should have a high chance of being relevant or at least interesting to you.

If you're going to share posts in Slack, please take the time to find the right channel for your post before you post it. You can find an excellent graphic showing all the channels in our community below. The channel names are pretty self explanatory.

## Read The Channel Resources
Rahul and I make sure that every channel has a good collection of topic, description, and bookmarked/pinned resources, so you can understand the rules of any channel and see the great content that has already been shared and created within it. Please go through all of these before posting in the channel to keep it a clean, focused place for healthy discussion and minimize the community having to solve the same problem twice.
