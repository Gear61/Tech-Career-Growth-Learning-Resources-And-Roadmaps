So if you are in India, and want to come to USA thru H1B below r the options:
1. Classic service companies - TCS,Infosys,CTS - There will be a lot of queue and competition within the company. 
You should be a manager (praising or fav) person, or lucky to be picked up in one of those projects where there could be onsite opportunity. 
Safe option as lot of things taken care by company. Negative is they pay less in Indian currency but "possible upside" of onsite
2. Product companies - Think why product companies setup shop in India. Answer is cost cutting. 
So that itself will tell tht there are not many options here whether it could be FAANG orother bigger product companies. 
There could be internal transfers, but definitely that number is far less than the above service based companies option. 
They pay good to excellent in Indian currency but less chance of onsite
3. Some consultancies (primarily staffing companies we call them in USA) - They apply for your H1B and you dont even need to be their employee in India. 
If H1B lottery picks up then u can resign and come to USA thru them. Pay will be brutal (most cases min what usa expects for H1B). 
But upside is u come here work there for 6months to 1 year and change to regular pay. Biggest Downside is - Fraud. 
Lot of times they take money(even tho illegal) and do the H1B.  This where you should check with some references and check websites to see how tht company did 
previously and their success rate. Websites like this can help to know https://www.myvisajobs.com/
