| Hey all, I’m Anil, a CS student in university. This past semester, I took the Android class Rahul made for CodePath, which is how I found out about his YouTube channel and this community.<br /><br />I’ve been wanting to work on personal projects for a while now, especially having learned the basics of Android development. However, I am a little lost on what to spend my time learning. I was planning on spending winter break building some apps, but I realized that I simply don’t like frontend development. Mainly, I have minimal interest in anything related to UI/UX development, which seems to be a significant chunk of the work. I enjoyed working with REST APIs or services like Parse, where all the development time is spent trying to make something functional, but working on any component of a project that’s purely visual is just not for me.<br /><br />One of the areas I’ve always thought would be interesting is backend development, since it sounds like lots of fun to build APIs that interface with a database to manipulate data. It sounds ideal for me, since most of your time is spent designing code, not a UI. I tried to look into getting started with API development, but it seems difficult to build anything without a frontend. Based on what I understand, APIs are generally designed to meet the needs of the frontend, so without at least an idea of what the final product would be like, it seems difficult to build anything interesting or useful. Furthermore, I know very little of how APIs are architected and built in the real world, so I wouldn’t even know if I’m doing it “right” (unlike frontends, where the end goal is much clearer to me).<br /><br />What would you recommend I do? I am of course open to other areas of software, I simply don’t know anything about them or how one would get started on their own.<br /><br />Another possibility I was considering is simply not bothering with coding projects for the moment. I have an internship next summer, so I will naturally learn a lot, and I’d have a better idea of what projects I want to build afterwards.<br /><br />Also, as a follow-up, how might one go about building projects with users if one is not building a project with a frontend?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your thoughts.) |

| Hey Sean, I am really sorry that you had such an experience but do let the recruiter know about this. If they feel you deserve a second chance, you might get one. As far as I have heard so far  the interviews are meant to be a discussion is what the FAANG companies recruiters wants. |

| Yeah, even at Big Tech, you can roll a bad interviewer - Sorry that you didn't have a good experience. The interview process also varies among Big Tech - I feel like Google and Facebook are more standardized, but I've heard the other 3 have more variance, especially Amazon as they are in hypergrowth from a headcount perspective.<br /><br />Something important I want to mention here is that the interviewer is meant to bring out the best in you and this will require some talking on their end, but there's some nuance to this. I can elaborate by breaking down more of how I was trained as an interviewer at Facebook.<br /><br />In particular, a good interviewer's job is to get signal of the candidate's skills. *This means that even though the interview should feel like more a conversation, the candidate has to be clearly driving the conversation.* When it comes to how much the interviewer responds, this means that we need to be on the lookout for what I call "fishing". Fishing is when the candidate doesn't seem to have a very clear idea of what they're doing, so they just propose something without a lot of conviction and hope the interviewer will tell them yes or no. The idea is that the candidate wins either way: If yes, then proceed down the path, if no, then propose other things. The problem here is that the interviewer is doing most of the work here crafting the solution, when it should be the other way around.<br /><br />This means that I would describe a good interviewer as more of a slight helping hand rather than a guide, which implies a more proactive stance. To clarify, let's have an example where I'm the interviewer giving a tricky graph traversal problem where the solution is DFS-based.<br /><br />If the candidate says something like, "Well, this seems like a graph problem, so I think DFS would be good here. Does that make sense?", I would perceive this as fishing as they aren't really justifying their strategy. I would say something more neutral like, "Well, we can code it up and find out if it works.", because I can't really say yes or no without doing a good amount of the problem for them.<br /><br />However, let's say that the candidate says something like, "We can envision X as nodes and Y as edges, so we can treat this as a graph or tree. Given that the problem requires us to prioritize the leaf nodes, we can use DFS to find the solution. I will implement DFS by doing A, B, C. It's better than BFS because of D, and these other solutions E, F, and G don't work as well because of these reasons. Does this make sense?" To me, this candidate clearly has a very strong grip of the problem. They are 95% sure, so they have done a lot of the work already. In this case, I would say something more affirmative like, "Yep, this makes sense!".<br /><br />Overall, this is a really tricky balance to strike, and obviously, we don't always get it right. At least for me, I'm always rooting for the candidate, which is why I don't want to give too many hints - This means you don't get enough signal and you need to fail them.<br /><br />Anyways, hope this helps @Sean and sheds light on what the perspective is like on the other side of the table (Big Tech interviewer's side) for folks in this channel. |

thanks for the encouragement @Abhishek Sheshagiri and thanks for the valuable insight @Alex. This is giving me something to think about when framing my answers |
