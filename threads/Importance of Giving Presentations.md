Question for the community:
1. How important to your career is giving presentations?
2.  If you've given presentations, what tools have you used that you feel helped?

[...]  

I'll go first :slightly_smiling_face:
1. I just did a demo presentation of some API code I wrote demonstrating proof of concept (POC). I thought it was a good case of communicating my thoughts and code design and proposing how it adds value to our current main task while showcasing how it works. I think the presentation forced me to really understand (in order to explain) the code I wrote and why I wrote it. tbh, I don't know how valuable it is to my career progression as an engineer (yet!) but I viewed it as an interesting experience.  fwiw i'm fairly introverted :laughing:
2. I used Camtasia to prerecord. It's relatively easy to edit video and I liked the zoom and highlight features as it applies to zooming in on parts of code.  Pro: prerecording enabled me to just hit play and answer questions after. Con: Camtasia's  free version has a watermark on the video and it's expensive for the pro version unless your company pays for it.  Terrastruct for system design diagrams. I've used Google Slides in the past, but for this demo, video did all the work.

1. While I was at Facebook, if you were on the product side and more senior, this was extremely important.
2. Google Slides with some recorded stuff from the Android device :smile:

I think presentations are super important. They’re critical to showing your depth of thinking, and how much you can bring people along with you on your project.  

One thing that took me a while to calibrate is to understand how much to _remove_ during presentations. People remember very, very little — you have to make things as simple as possible to communicate your main point. Remove extraneous words and details.

presentations are essential moving beyond an individual contributor role at anything larger than an early startup, and are essential for all roles at large companies  
i think of a spectrum between doing and thinking/talking/guiding (which includes presentations).  
early in your careers and at small companies, it's only "doing"  
CEOs (almost) only are thinking/talking/guiding,  
and the more you practice presentations, the less stressful/ more fun/ more effective you'll be if you get to a point when you need to do it

Another thing to note is making sure you know who your audience is and their technical level. I've given presentations to management 3 levels higher that was not technical at all which requires a much higher level of how a system was designed. All of this compared to one I gave to my peers, which was a much lower level

love that and totally agree @Sean Barber.  Reminds me of one of my all time favorite quotes:  

Soren Kierkegaard, The Journals, 1854  
“. . . if real success is to attend the effort to bring a man to a definite position, one must first of all take pains to find him where he is and begin there.
This is the secret of the art of helping others. Anyone who has not mastered this is himself deluded when he proposes to help others. In order to help another effectively, I must understand what he understands. If I do not know that, my greater understanding will be of no help to him. If, however, I am disposed to plume myself on my greater understanding, it is because I am vain or proud, so that at bottom, instead of benefiting him, I want to be admired. But all true effort to help does not mean to be a sovereign but to be a servant, that to help does not mean to be ambitious but to be patient, that to help means to endure for the time being the imputation that one is in the wrong and does not understand what the other understands . . .

Presentations are super important specially if you can show case your worth to the company.  
I did a presentation about the work I had been doing at the company and this gave visibility to all engineers and higher ups of all the work and dedication i had done for the company. Because of that I managed to negotiate into a better position.  

2 - my presentation had live demos and I even showed code.
The presentation lasted one hour and I managed to make it entertaining. I even put it on YouTube as unlisted so I can use it as leverage for some other future company assuming it serves for anything and is valuable. I ended up using this as documentation for the project as well.
 It helped we had some training sessions on presenting. We got some nice tips which I will share with everyone. Deep Breath  
 
Tips On presenting:
Interact with the audience while presenting.
When practising speak ! Don't practice to yourself you need to listen to your voice. Speak up!
You need to treat a presentation like a performance (imagine you are doing a musical concert, a competition or something of that nature. You can't just "be yourself" you need to have some level of high energy and be engaging else people will get bored. You need to feel passion for it so other people get contagious by your passion)
Try to get a few topics that you want the audience to remember.  

I even had a a timer and divided my presentation into 3 parts which I then divided through the 1 hour I had to do it.
Practice until you are comfortable and know what you want to say on each slide.
Practice transitions between slides. They need to tell a story. Don't just go like "oh yeah. This slide is about X. This slide is about Y".
Don't say fill words like "huummm." "Aaaah".  

Just control yourself say nothing if you feel those words coming. Silence is powerful it makes people listen and re focus on you.
Re-engage with the audience "if you look at X you will see Y" "think about what this means" "why do you think X happened?" Use these questions just to make people pay attention to you.  

If you are feeling bored or uninspired people will also feel that. What you feel the audience feels!
Don't say thank you at the end. It makes you look weak, (but this is very hard to do).
Don't be monocordic. Try to use use fluctuation in your words, else it will be a bit boring for the audience.
Be confident! Train as much as you need to, don't forget to speak when studying the presentation, it makes a total difference. You can time yourself the first time will be terrible and slow, my presentation the first time I did took 2 hours then 1h30 then 1hour and I think I managed to get it under 1h when I did it for real to give time for QA.  

Tips on Slides:  
The less text the better.  
Short slides.  
One idea per slide.  
A lot of pictures.  
The slides should just serve as a very very minimal support. Like small checkpoints just to ground the audience on where you are on the journey you are telling them.  

Tips on structuring and the process of creating a presentation:  
1 - start with the idea / topic  
2 - what do you want the audience to know at the end of your presentation (not too much, 3 main take aways)  
3 - write each slide what you want to talk about (one idea per slide)  

If you want hard core mode:  
After step 3 you can go crazy and try to start just rehersing your presentation with the slides you have. You will then adjust the slides with all the extra things you didn't remember. Present and train until the slides are good and support your presentation.  

Easy mode:  
Finish up the slides totally and then practice and present.
Practice makes perfect! The more you practice the less anxious you will be. The more everything is in your control the less anxious.  

As a final example for my presentation:  
I practices with zoom on, sharing my screen, and having all the Mac desktops as I wanted them, one for code, one for slides, one for UI of the app (I'm a frontend dev).
I'm not perfect but I think I did a pretty good job on my presentation and these tips helped me. I hope they can help you as well :)
