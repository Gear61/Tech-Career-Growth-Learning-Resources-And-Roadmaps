I received an offer with stock options, but there is this clause in it that seems a bit harsh. Is this normal?
> You should be aware that (COMPANY NAME)., in its discretion, may change or terminate the Plan at any time. If (COMPANY NAME) decides to change or terminate the Plan, you will not have any claims against (COMPANY NAME). to receive stock units or any other benefits equivalent to stock units. You acknowledge that (COMPANY NAME). is not obligated to continue to grant stock units or any other benefits to you.

IMO this type of scary language is fairly standard and usually used to give the company the ability to do something which they almost never utilize. I’d clarify two things:
* does the company have an obligation to honor the initial equity grant given to you? if this clause only applies to “refresh” grants, it’s not as scary
* is the company/founding team reputable + trustworthy? if so, I wouldn’t worry about it. Do you have friends you trust already at the company? A lot of tech is based on a shared understanding, so make sure you have alignment there, even if it’s not clear if that’s reflected in the legal-ese.

Thanks @Rahul Pandey . I have understood its pretty standard in the industry and ended up signing, but to answer your questions
* This applied to the “plan” which wasnt only the initial equity grant but just both.
* Yeah I would say its trustworthy, I don’t know anybody on the inside but I heard good things on blind and they have they’re in the top 5 companies to work for in the U.S (on Glassdoor)

I did point it out and they said the same thing, its pretty standard clause and
> COMPANY NAME and the board always have a right to take away stocks, however, it has never happened before and shouldn’t cause concern.

Yeah standard legal boilerplate. The board of directors has to approved stock grants of all kinds and that has to happen in some future board event, so if something crazy happens and that board event never happens, the offer letter alone doesn't grant you a legal claim to the stock.
